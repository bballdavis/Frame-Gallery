"""Search caching and the daily highlights, shared by the endpoints.

Searches are cached on disk for a day (per source, query, page and type), so repeating a
search, switching a shape filter, or opening the page again costs the sources nothing. The
cache stores the source's raw page and the shape and sharpness filters are applied
afterwards, which is why changing them never needs a new request.
